Aurora Community was my life. I was a big meme for all. Even tho Aurora has had a rough history, I stood by it even after the nuke. I was a Mod in Aurora for a short time - that was my best time in the community. All the drama, the Gordon Ramsay memes, jokes about my English, and me talking about my servers. I loved it, then Novus came along and that is where I spend most of my time now.
